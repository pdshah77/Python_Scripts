# Python_Scripts

*This Repository is created to add Programs asked in Interviews.*

I usually try to code random programs which I came across on Internet in form of Interview Question or some random programs I feel like doing it.

I have used Python 3.7 to code and took reference of [GreeksForGreeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-programming-language/) to understand logic if I ever stuck at any point.
