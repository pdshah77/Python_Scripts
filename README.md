# Python_Scripts
This Repository is created to add Programs asked in Interviews. 

I usually try to code random programs which I came across on Internet in form of Interview Question or some random programs I feel like doing it.

I have used Python 3.7 to code and took reference of GreeksForGreeks to understand logic if I ever stuck at any point.
