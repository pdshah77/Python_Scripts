This Repository is created to add Programs asked in Interviews. 

I usually try to code random programs which I came across on Internet in form of Interview Question or some random programs I feel like doing it.

I have used Python 3.7 to code and took reference of GreeksForGreeks to understand logic if I ever stuck at any point.

**Even_Number.py** : This type of Programs are stating point of Coding Interview just to check if you are using Python List Comprehension Method or not.

**Prime_Number.py** : Using For Else Loop availble in Python 

**Palindrom_Number.py** : Given Number is Palindrom if Number or String Reads same from Back Side also. Most common Interview Question

**addFirstLastElement.py** : I was Asked to add First and Last Element of a String and print it in new line.
